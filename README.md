My research for the past year has been concerned with identifying oscillations in solar-type stars due to magnetic activity. This is a specific goal that falls under the category of Asteroseismology, which
seeks to investigate stellar interiors by examining the different power spectrums that are produced from this activity. The notebooks presented here are a few examples from the Summer of 2024 where
I participated in a Research Experience for Undergraduates as part of a program at The New Jersey Insitute of Technology. My mentor is Doctor Alexander Kosovichev, himself a distinguished professor at the university.
Although the research is ongoing, I have a learned a great deal about data analysis and stellar astrophysics which I beleive will greatly assist me in the future!
